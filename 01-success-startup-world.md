# Success in the Startup world

To be successful in the world of start-ups you need to be aggressive and look for each advantage that you have and use it to its full potential instead of ignoring it.

Some people are born with natural talents and those talents (if honed correctly) become their unfair advantages Find what you are passionate about and then try to create a company around it.

## The story of SnapChat

Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snapchat, came from a wealthy background both his parents were lawyers and received an Ivy-league education.

All of this factors combined to form Evan's unfair advantages which then he applied to Snapchat and made it into the app we all use every day.

## Sacrifice

To be successful in the long run you'll have to sacrifice your short term pleasures and keep on working hard to get the results that you desired.

If you have a talent for something work extra hard to polish it and that will become your biggest unfair advantage. If you keep refining your talents, you'll find more about yourself especially about your weaknesses. Which you can then work to overcome them.

Creating and Launching a startup is no easy task and requires a lot of hard work and determination. Other people won't tell you their struggles and only show their victories. 

This can create a false sense of doubt but you can also achieve what they have if you work hard enough. You'll have to sacrifice your mental and physical health in order to create your start up. Best way to avoid this is by following a project plan or structure.
