# Unfair Advantages

An unfair advantage is something that puts you ahead of your competition. Each person has their own unique unfair advantage.

You can develop more than one unfair advantage or combine yours with your friends. The unfair advantage of your friends can complement yours so that you both can leverage each other's best abilities.

## Growth Mindset

In this world, nothing will be a fair game. Sometimes you'll win, sometimes lose. But the most important part is keeping a positive mindset.

Your thinking greatly affects your ability to work. Always have a mindset that is ready to learn or better known as a growth mindset.

> Dream big, but in the beginning start small and then scale from there.

## The M.I.L.E.S framework

The authors developed a system called the MILES framework that can help anyone find and refine their own unfair advantages.

- The first unfair advantage that you can have is obviously money.

- The second one is intelligence and insight about the field you work in.

- The third unfair advantage is another clich√© one and that is luck. If you don't have good luck you can easily change that by being in the right place at the right time

- The Fourth is education, Without a proper education you won't be able to find your unfair advantage.

- Status is the final unfair advantage that you can have like Evan Spiegel that you vastly help you in life.

## Creating a startup

Before you create a startup you need to first answer the question: Why are you creating this? Each person will have their own answer to this question.

You also need to figure out what type of company you'll build. A lifestyle company or a digital product or service.

Investors are excited only in products that can disrupt an industry or are capable of doing that. So plan your idea correctly. Not every idea can be turned into a startup. 

If it's a totally new concept you'll have to educate people on how to use your product. If your product is an immediate success, chances are that a bigger company might offer to buy your product. 

You can't create and manage your company alone. Find someone that wants to work with you and create a team so that you don't have to burden everything on your shoulders. Conflicts can happen between founders and can cause negative effects on the company.

When raising funds for your company keep the introduction short and simple and if you can then show the investors an MVP of your company.
